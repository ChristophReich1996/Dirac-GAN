# DiracGAN

This repository implements (PyTorch) the DiracGAN proposed in the paper "Which Training Methods for GANs do actually Converge?" by [Mescheder](https://github.com/LMescheder) et al. [1]. The original implementation of the authors can be found [here](https://github.com/LMescheder/GAN_stability).

This work was done as part of the lecture deep generative models at TU Darmstadt supervised by [Dr. Anirban Mukhopadhyay](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/gris/startseite_1/team/team_details_60224.en.jsp).
